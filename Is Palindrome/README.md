# Is Palindrome

Given a string ```s```, return ```true``` if it is a palindrome, otherwise return ```false```.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.


## Examples

### Example 1:

``` python 
Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

Output: true

```
Explanation: After considering only alphanumerical characters we have "wasitacaroracatisaw", which is a palindrome.

### Example 2:
``` python
Input: s = "tab a cat"

Output: false

```
Explanation: "tabacat" is not a palindrome.
