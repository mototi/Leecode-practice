# Sum Of Two Integers

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices ```i``` and ```j``` such that ```nums[i] + nums[j] == target``` and ```i != j```.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices ```i``` and ```j``` that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first. 

## Examples


### Example 1:

``` python 
Input: nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]

```

### Example 2:
``` python
Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10

Output: [0,2]

```
